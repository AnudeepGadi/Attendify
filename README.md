## Motivation
<p align="justify">
Attendance is a particularly important aspect of the academic activity. It provides insights into the engagement and participation of students. The traditional paper-based attendance involves a lot of manual effort and is prone to errors. Attendify is a cloud based online attendance system, professors can track the attendance of the students and can generate reports. These reports can be used to identify attendance patterns of the students and can help to design attendance policies, also teachers can use this data while grading the students’ involvement in the class. Attendify is being designed to be a fool proof system. Attendify collects various information like IP address and device id (generated by Attendify) of the student when they are marking their attendance. There are SQL scripts being developed to check for anomalies. For example, if a student in the classroom marks attendance for another student also, then 2 attendances will be marked from the same IP address. From this we can identify who marked false attendance. Another example can be, if the access code is shared outside the classroom and attendance is marked by students who are not present in the classroom, we can identify IP addresses which do not belong to UMKC (University of Missouri Kansas City). Students should always mark their attendance by connecting to UMKC Wi-Fi. Non-UMKC IP addresses can be identified, and they can be marked as false attendance. This project is a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the working of Attendify and the impact it can bring.

## User Story 
### Admin: 
- The professor logs into the Attendify admin web application and generates an access code.
- After the completion of attendance, the professor will disable the access code, which means the access code can no longer be used.
- Later the professor can generate the report in the form of an excel from the application.
### Student: 
- Students should login to the Attendify user web application.
- Submit the access code and attendance will be marked.
